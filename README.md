## üìÑ Description

üè° Discover an application to explore the French real estate market.

ü§î ‚ÄúHow much does accommodation cost in my city? In my neighborhood?‚Äù These are questions that I have often asked myself. And to my great surprise, it was difficult to find clear and precise answers, in agencies or on the internet. That's why I created this tool.

Here's a little app that lets you dive into real estate transactions in France from 2018 to today. Use customizable filters to analyze market trends by region, year and property type. An ideal tool for individuals and professionals who wish to have an overview of the real estate market.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup & Usage

You can run the application in two ways:

- **Locally using `uv`**
- **Using Docker Compose**

### üîß Option 1 ‚Äî Run Locally with `uv`

> `uv` is a fast and modern Python tool that handles virtual environments and dependencies via `pyproject.toml`.

1. **Install `uv`** (if not already installed)  
   ```bash
   curl -Ls https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
   ```

2. **Clone the repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/LudovicGardy/app_name
   cd app_folder/
   ```

3. **Create and activate the environment**  
   ```bash
   uv venv
   ```

   - On **macOS/Linux**:
     ```bash
     source .venv/bin/activate
     ```

   - On **Windows** (PowerShell):
     ```powershell
     .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
     ```

4. **(Optional) If the virtual environment doesn't behave properly**

   Sometimes, on macOS in particular, the environment might be missing some tooling (like `pip`). You can try the following fixes:

   ```bash
   .venv/bin/python -m ensurepip --upgrade
   .venv/bin/python -m pip install --upgrade pip
   # Optional: Only if you need to use Jupyter notebooks
   .venv/bin/python -m pip install ipykernel -U --force-reinstall
   ```

5. **Launch the app**  
   ```bash
   streamlit run main.py
   ```

### üê≥ Option 2 ‚Äî Run with Docker Compose

1. **Make sure Docker and Docker Compose are installed and running**

2. **Go to the project directory**
   ```bash
   cd path/to/app_folder
   ```

3. **Build and start the app**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

4. **Access the app**
   Open your browser at: [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501)

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

### Pre-commit Hooks

This project uses pre-commit to maintain code quality. The following hooks are configured:

- **Basic hooks**: checking for trailing whitespaces, end-of-file formatting, YAML and TOML file verification, etc.
- **Ruff**: Python code linting and formatting
- **Codespell**: spell checking
- **Commitizen**: checking commit messages according to the defined convention

To install pre-commit:

```bash
# Install dependencies
uv pip install pre-commit ruff

# Install git hooks
pre-commit install
```

The hooks will run automatically with each commit. You can also run them manually:

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files  # Run on all files
pre-commit run ruff         # Run a specific hook
```

Ruff configuration is defined in `pyproject.toml` and includes:
- reStructuredText docstring format
- Import checking
- Double quote formatting
- Line length limited to 100 characters
